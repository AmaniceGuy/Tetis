# Tetis
Tetris (although I called it Tetros) created with python and pygame

All the classes and main code are in 1 file (tetros.py), because when I made this I didn't 
have the luxury of creating multiple files. All the other files are pictures, music, or fonts.

My code uses global constants that I could place inside functions but I felt that in a project
so small, with only 1 person contributing, using global constants would be acceptable because
there are not too many variables to begin with, and this project was not very complex.

If you dont' have pygame or python, just run the .exe file
